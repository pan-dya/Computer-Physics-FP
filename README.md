# Ski Jumping Simulation - Computer Physics Final Project

This repository made in order to create a simulation of Ski Jumping. The aim of this project is to give a better insight and knowledge for
begginer so that they know how to do Ski Jumping in the right way. This project will calculate all the requirements with Physics Formula and some
mathematical things to know the best way to do the Ski Jumping technique and also to read the best condition for doing the sports. Below is some detail
information about the project.

## Project Details

`Features`
- Tkinter Form
- Simulator


`input`
- Mass 
- Height of the hill  
- Height of the ramp 
- Degree of inrun 
- Degree of slope 

`output`
- Graph with ski jumping animation
- Speed at the ramp and after landing
- Landing at specific angle
- How far the skier jump

## Program manual
In order to start the program, it simply just runs the code in any IDE that supports the python language. After that, there will be a form that the user should input in order to start the simulation. Below is the image on how to start the simulation :
